        <p class="pb-5 text-slate-300 font-sans">
          The first thing we recommend you to do is to schedule a discovery flight.  This is where you take the controls of an airplane and go flying with a flight instructor.  After the flight, you can decide if this is right for you.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-5 text-slate-300 font-sans">
          If you want to continue, then we'll pair you up with an instructor and you'll start training.  From there you'll get the aeronautical knowledge needed to pass your pilot exams.  You start off with obtaining your private pilot certificate which allows you to fly planes with passengers.  From there, you can pursue additional ratings and certifications depending on what your aviation goals are.

        Why do we recommend a <span class="text-teal-500">discovery flight?</span></h2>
      <p class="py-10 font-sans text-lg">
        A discovery flight is a sneak peek into the world of aviation and a chance to get your feet a little wet. We think it's a pretty good idea and the best first step for anyone dreaming of flying. At Pitcairn Flight Academy, we're all about providing a hands on experience and making sure you're making the right call when it comes to your aviation journey.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-10 font-sans text-lg">
        During a discovery flight, you get to hop into the cockpit, take the controls, and feel what it's like to be the one flying the plane. It's a bit like a test drive for flying, without the pressure of committing to a full blown pilot's license. We recommend it because there's usually two outcomes out of the introductory flight. One, either you don't like it and you can determine that becoming is not right for you.  Or two, you fall in love with it and you make the decision that becoming a pilot is right for you.  It's usually the latter.  So don't wait, get on the schedule today and let's go flying together.

      This really depends on your aviation goals.  Are you looking to make a career out of flying or do you want to fly for fun?  Many pilots stop at their private or instrument and fly around town leisurely, while other pilots who want to make a career out of flying move on to getting their commercial certificate and flight instructor certificates.  Contact us and talk to one of our team members to determine what's right for you.
