      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">Pitcairn Flight Academy is a part of a family of aviation companies under Pitcairn Aviation LLC. Alongside Penn Air Repair, PennJet Charters, and Pitcairn FBO, Pitcairn Flight Academy was born out of the minds of founders David and Rachel Pitcairn, who acquired the Heritage Field Airport (KPTW) in Limerick-Pottstown, PA, in 2022. Since then, the flight academy has swelled in number of students and success, eclipsing 10,000 hours of flight training and 100+ students graduated since its inception.</p>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-4xl pt-10">Our Leadership</h2>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">Pitcairn Aviation LLC was founded in 2022 by David and Rachel Pitcairn and thus was born the flight academy. We would be remiss not to highlight our exceptional leadership team who keep the academy running smoothly day after day. Please meet Marisa Doerstling, our administrator, and Andrew (Andy) Landis, our Chief Pilot.</p>

        <p class="text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">Chief Flight Instructor</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">Originally from Souderton, PA, Andy started his time in flight training over 20 years ago. What started as an escape from a busy day job soon evolved into a love and passion for flying. Since then, Andy has surged through the ranks and acquired an impressive list of certificates and ratings (like ATP, CFI, CFII, MEI, CFI-G, tailwheel, and float plane pro) to accompany his extensive knowledge in flight training. Outside of Pitcairn Flight Academy, you can find Andy flying his KR-03A glider, scuba diving, and going on other adventures in the outdoors.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-base leading-7 text-gray-300">Marisa is a native Floridian who followed her heart up to Bucks County to marry a pilot. She’s been around aviation for most of her life and started volunteering at her local airshow back in 2009. Although always fascinated by airplanes, Marisa still claims to be terrified of flying! <br><br>If not at PTW, Marisa is up at DYL either playing with cars or working on/flying in one of her husband’s 2 airplanes. Marisa’s other hobbies include thrifting, makeup, playing video games, photography (website photo cred to her!), and hanging out with her dog, Ben. Make sure to stop by the front desk to meet Marisa and Ben!</p>
