					</svg>I'm so glad that I have gotten the chance to attend this Flight Academy. When I started my journey to find the right place, I didn't even know where to start. Here they start you off with your discovery flight. This is to make sure flying is what you truly want to do. This is where I met my instructor, Darren. He makes the process super easy and almost seamless. Everyone here is super kind and patient and go at your speed. The environment is always so positive and welcoming. You get to meet people from all over the east coast and share stories of our love for flying. If you weren't sure where to start your path to piloting, I recommend starting here. I can't wait to continue my lessons and pursue the path of my dreams!

            </svg>I’ve been a student at Pitcairn for over a year. They have put great care into selecting the best possible team and creating the best possible curriculum to help students learn at their own pace. Because they take the time to know their students abilities and aspirations, they can tailor training to your needs. And they do it all at a very reasonable price. This has allowed me to expedite my training. The entire staff (ground crew, maintenance, customer service, instructors, and ownership) are very friendly and accommodating. I could not recommend Barry and the entire team more highly. If you’re looking for a place to learn to fly or brush up on your skills, this is it.

					</svg>So far, I have been a student at Pitcairn for a little over a month, and I have to say it is one of the most welcoming places I have ever been to. The instructors are super friendly and professional, and most importantly, safe. My instructor (Darren) always makes sure that I am prepared for whatever we are doing, and never hesitates to cancel a lesson if he feels it is at all unsafe, even if he loses some flight time and money from doing so. If there is anywhere I would recommend flying for any sort of certification or rating, it would be here.
